    Particle Auth Core X Layer Demo
  </h3>
</div>

⚡️ Full-stack demo application showcasing the implementation of Particle Auth Core (Particle Network's flagship React-based Wallet-as-a-Service SDK) within applications built on X Layer. Specifically, this demo facilitates social login, the assignment of a smart account, and the execution of 0.001 OKB burn, which is automatically gasless through the usage of Particle Network's Omnichain Paymaster.

🛠️ Try the demo: https://particle-xlayer-demo.replit.app

Built using **Particle Auth Core**, **TypeScript**, **Particle AA SDK**

## 🔑 Particle Auth Core
Particle Auth Core, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc. - as an alternative to Particle Auth, the Auth Core SDK comes with more control over the modal itself, application-embedded popups rather than redirects, and so on.
